Sure! Here's a **comprehensive, concise Markdown summary** of our discussion for your future reference, including decisions, exploration, and links:


# Personal Contact Graph System - Summary

## **1. Goal**
Create a digital system to track all people you meet (college, meetups, random, events) with:
- Timeline view
- Calendar view
- Graph/network view
- Map view
- Search/filter using tags and metadata

---

## **2. Requirements**
- Entities: `Person`, `Event`
- Relationships:
  - `ATTENDED` → Person → Event
  - `MET` → Person → Person (actual interaction at event)
  - `KNOWS` → Person → Person (real acquaintance)
- Properties:
  - Person: `name`, `phone`, `email`, `tags`, `notes`, `first_met`, `last_contacted`
  - Event: `name`, `date`, `location`, `lat/lon`, `tags`, `notes`
  - Relationships: `date`, `role`, `strength`, `notes`

---

## **3. Decisions & History**
- Considered software for personal graph management:
  - Clay.earth, Getdex.com → not open source
  - Neo4j chosen due to free community edition, graph features, visualization
- Decided **to build minimal DB + graph UI first**, not full product
- Chose to keep both `ATTENDED` and `KNOWS`:
  - ATTENDED alone doesn’t imply you actually know someone
  - MET optional to track brief interaction
- Timeline, calendar, map, and graph views planned in phases
- Start simple → incrementally add features

---

## **4. Explored / Considered**
- **Software**
  - Clay.earth, Getdex.com
  - Airtable / Notion / Obsidian (limited graph/timeline support)
  - Neo4j (community edition)
- **Graph Modeling**
  - Nodes: Person, Event
  - Relationships: ATTENDED, MET, KNOWS
  - Properties for filtering/search
- **Visualization**
  - Neo4j Browser
  - Neo4j Bloom
  - Future: Frontend using Cytoscape.js / D3.js / Mapbox
- **Data Modeling Questions**
  - Difference between ATTENDED, MET, KNOWS
  - Whether ATTENDED implies knowing someone → separate KNOWS maintained
  - Use of relationship properties for timeline / tags

---

## **5. Practical Usage**
1. **Adding data**
   - Add Person + Event nodes
   - Create ATTENDED relationship
   - Create MET only if interacted
   - Create KNOWS if acquaintance
2. **Querying**
   - People attended an event
   - Who you actually know
   - Who you met but don’t know
   - Filter by tags, date, or event
3. **Visualization**
   - Graph view in Neo4j Browser / Bloom
   - Timeline view via event dates
   - Map view via `lat/lon` on Event nodes
4. **Workflow**
   - Daily: Add new contacts and events
   - Periodically: Review graph, update KNOWS relationships, search/filter
   - Optional: Export to calendar or map for planning

## **6. Example Text-Based Graph**

## **7. Next Steps / Plan**
- Phase 1: Implement Neo4j DB with Person & Event nodes, ATTENDED relationships
- Phase 2: Add MET & KNOWS relationships, practice queries
- Phase 3: Visualize graph and timeline in Neo4j Browser/Bloom
- Phase 4 (optional): Frontend integration for interactive timeline, map, search

This covers **everything we discussed**: goals, requirements, data model, decisions, exploration, practical usage, examples, and next steps.

If you want, I can also make a **single-page visual diagram summary** showing **all nodes, relationships, and timeline flow** for easy reference.

Do you want me to do that?
